# ubik-syntax theme

![Alt text](/../screenshots/screenshot.jpeg?raw=true "Optional Title")

Disclaimer:
I strongly recommend to leave the dark background unchanged and to couple it with a
dark UI theme too (I am using Seti UI right now).

Inspired by the gotham colorscheme, modified and enriched to better highlight code.
Code highlighting is done by altering / adding new colors to the base gotham scheme
and by experimenting with font styling; this is by far still a growing pet project
of mine: as I code more and in more language I will tweak it according to my eyes'
fatigue and aesthetic sense.

Since I mostly code in Python  that is where my customisation show itself the most.

SPECIAL:
  Jinja code is supported if you use atom-jinja2.

If you have any suggestions, please don't hesitate to let me know.
Happy Coding!

Ubik
